	<p>
		<strong>Mechanical Engineering student at Imperial College London</strong>
		with strong foundations in analytical problem-solving and systems thinking. I
		work across physical and digital systems, with particular interests in
		thermofluids, mechatronics, and software development. A enthusiastic
		problem-solver who thrives on diverse technical challenges, from circuit
		design to full-stack development. Outside academics, I play music and am a
		keen ultra-runner.
