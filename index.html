			<h3>Online Art Commissioning Marketplace: Otterkin</h3>
			<p>
				This is a startup I am building the MVP for in Rails. It's a
				sophisticated platform for commissioning high-profile UK-based artists
				without all the pain of going through a gallery. Beta launch early
				September. Check it out <a href="https://otterkin.co.uk">here</a>.

			<h3>Web-based Homemade CFD in Golang + WASM</h3>
			<p>
				A fun personal learning project, with an end goal of displaying
				vortex shedding behvaiour and a focus on running performant compiled
				code in the browser.  Is a current blog series.

			<h3>Cryo-Ultrasonic Testing Rig (for additiviely manufactured parts)</h3>
			My third year Design Make and Test (DMT) group project for the
			Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) Lab at Imperial. I was in the slurry
			mixing and preparation sub-group and headed up the mixer design as well
			as all the control electronics. This was a super formative project for me
			as I started feeling well out of my depth but by the end of the year had
			not only picked up enough subject knowledge to be dangerous but also had
			built friendly relationships with all the necessary staff to get stuff
			done. Detailed blog post pending (stay tuned!).

		<li class="home__project-bullet">
			<h3>Beavis Board for Guitar Pedal Prototyping</h3>
			<p>
				This was my entry point into pedal making and it was a really cool beginner
				project for hobby electronics: The circuitry was not complex at all and
				the end product is a really powerful tool for future experimentation!
				I have so many plans for extending this first version - cannot wait.

			<h3>Interactive Fluid Sim with Python and Pygame</h3>
			<p>
				It all started when I was looking for a reason to learn Rust (the
				programming language) properly and the idea of "building a CFD code"
				popped into my head as a suitable project for experimenting with
				concurrency. Needless to say one does not simply "bulid a CFD code"
				BUT it was the push I needed to get into the books and start learning
				the theory. Managed to find a 1980s textbook written by a former
				Imperial prof, was delighted I could actually follow the maths, and so
				built a toy 2D convection diffusion solver.

	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<ul class="home__faq-list">
		<li class="home__faq-bullet">
			<h3>Why have done so much web-dev if you are studying mechanical engineering?</h3>
			<p>
				In short: It's fun, very accessible (a laptop is a lot easier to obtain than
				a workshop), and complements traditional engineering practices in more ways
				than expected. Having a multi-disciplinary perspective is very helpful
				for many problems, and programming literacy is an increasingly important
				skill for any interesting modern engineering.

			<h3>Why is the hero section of this page so <em>baller</em>?</h3>
			I know! I didn't think it'd go so hard but I'm so pleased with how it's turned
			out.
